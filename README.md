Hey Zane,

Maurice here. So hopefully by the time you've read this I will have written the HTML code and integrated it properly using Flask and Jinja. Since I've taken care of most of the formatting of the websiteand tweaking the server-client conneciton code to fit our project, as per Terra's instructions, the best way you can help is by:

1) formatting all the SQL INSERT code into engine.execute() statements. If you vim into the server.py file, you'll find near the top that there's a section talking about engine.execute() and SQLAlchemy. I gave an example of the kind of statement you need to make and how to format the SQL code within the engine.execute() methods.

2) Find out where to put the drop table SQL code in the python file? Find out if we need to put anywhere in the python code at all?

3) Start making some SQL queries, like the one Tera's used as an example near the bottom of the code, that correspond with the Flask code I've written (i.e. queries that correspond with the information that the end-user has indicated on the HTML/Flask web-interface that he/she would like to see.)
